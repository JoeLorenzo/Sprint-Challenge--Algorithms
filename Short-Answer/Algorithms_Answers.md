#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n^3)
Because as n increases relative to the constant 'a' then n is cubed. The while loop will take  
n^3 longer to complete as n increases. n^2 is ignored because it is not significant term.

b) O(log n)
Because the number of times the loop runs is increasing slower than the size of the input is increasing this would be O(log n).

c) O(n)
Because this function is dependent on 'n' and decreases by n-1 this is a linear function. for example if n = 10 bunnies then this function will run 10 times.

## Exercise II

runtime for my algorithm O(n)

starting from the bottom of the building iterate through the floors until the first egg is broken, this will give us 'f'. Because this is a linear function the runtime is O(n).
